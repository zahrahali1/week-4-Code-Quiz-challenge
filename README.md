# <Code Quiz Challenge 4>

## Description

This week as a coding boot camp student I am creating a quiz application that allow users to answer questions within a time limit. The quiz should track high scores by saving their initials and scores.

First off this is how the welcome page looks like:

Then the next page will be the first question and the user has options to choose an answer

You can see here that when the user clicks on the answer it will show at the bottom if its correct or wrong
